## Description

This program simulates the game of Hex and uses the Monte Carlo method to evaluate the best move for the AI player. The game is played on a hexagonal board with black and white cells. The AI player (white) uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate multiple random moves and selects the move with the highest chance of winning. The human player (black) can make moves by entering the cell index.

## Usage

1. Enter the size of the board (greater than 2).
2. The game starts with the human player (black) making the first move.
3. The AI player (white) uses the Monte Carlo method to select its move.
4. The game continues until one of the players wins.
5. The winning player is displayed, and the game ends.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
